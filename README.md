-Custom Motor driver<br>
-Custom BMS<br>
-Custom Cad Model<br>
<br>
IGVC Team<br>
Custom Remote controller(WIP):<br>
 Parts: Raspberry Pi 5, Analog Joysticks, TFT Screen <br>
 -Coding the Raspberry Pi 5 to work with an Analog Joystick as a cursor <br>
 -Displaying sensor data, giving robot commands on TFT Screen <br>
Re-designed E-Stop remote: <br>
